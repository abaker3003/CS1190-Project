        1. Federal Student Loans
      </h3>
      Federal student loans are student loans that are guarenteed by the federal government. The government offers
      different types of student loans. Some of the loans have a total loan limit which means that your loan ammounts
      accumulate to a total amount and once that limit is reached, you are no longer eligible for federal student loans.
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>
            Subsidized Loans
          </strong></li>
        Direct subsudized loans do not accrue interest while an individual is in school or during their 6 month grace
        period while they are our of school or graduate.
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>
            Direct Unsubsidized Loans
          </strong></li>
        Direct unsubsidized loans acrue interest from the first day you receive them. In other words, these federal
        loans accummulate interest while you are in school.
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>
            Direct PLUS Loans
          </strong></li>
        According to StudentAid.gov, Direct PLUS loans are for graduate or professional students AND parents of
        dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Unlike
        Federal Subsudized and Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS loans are not based upon financial need.
        <br>
        <br>

        <li><strong>
            Consolidation Loans
          </strong></li>
        Direct consolidated loans is the term given for federal loans combined into one loan so that the payee is able
        to make one payment instead of multiple loan payments. This option typically occurs after your 6-month grace
        period or 6-months after you graduate.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Federal loan is best for you.

      <br>

      <h3>
        2. Private
      </h3>
      Private student loans are offered by private institutions and typically have a higher interest rate and shorter
      time period to pay back the loans.
      <p></p>
      Unlike Federal subsidized and Federal unsibsidized loans, private student loans are not based upon financial need
      and require a credit check. If you are a student with little to no credit history, you will most likely need a
      co-signer to help you secure a private student loan.

    <!--- AUTO LOANS --->

    </button>
    <div class="accordian_content">
      <p></p>
      Insurance companies go hand-in-hand with auto loans. Insurance companies tend to give discounts to vehicles that
      are less than two years old. Additionally, when you have a new car loan, insurance companies require you to have a
      insurance for full coverage.
      <h3>
        1. New Car Loans
      </h3>
      A new car loan is a loan for a new vehicle. You would be the first owner of the vehicle. Typically, new vehicles
      have a lower interest rate, however, they typically cost more at the time of purchase.
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        2. Used Car Loans
      </h3>
      Used car loans apply to vehicles that have had at least one owner. Used vehicles have a higher interest rate,
      however, they typically cost less at the time of purchase.
      <p></p>
      When purchasing a used vehicle, you should inspect the vehicle's past history and mechanics if possible. For
      example, is the vehicle leaking oil, do all the doors and locks work, does the vehicle need new tires soon, was
      the vehicle previously in an accident and fixed up, etc? Oftentimes, you can ask the dealership for the cars
      history before you purchase the used vehicle.

      <h3>
        3. Auto loan refinancing
      </h3>
      If your credit score is better anytime after you purchase your and you want to get a better interest rate on your
      vehicle loan, you can ask your bank/credit union (or a different bank/credit union) to refinance your auto loan.
      <p></p>
      Generally, the time to wait to refinance a loan is six months from the start of your loan. Many times, you are not
      able to refinance your auto loan if you are upside down on your loan. Upside down means that you owe more for the
      vehicle than the vehicle is worth.

      <h3>
        4. Leasing a vehicle
      </h3>
      Leasing a vehicle is when you have a contract to rent a car for a specified period of time from the dealership.You
      do not own the vehicle. When the period of time is up, you can look into options to purchase the vehicle you were
      leasing, or lease another vehicle.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>&emsp;Payday Loans</h2>
    </button>
    <div class="accordian_content">
      <p></p>
      Payday loans are a type of short-term loan (as in your next pay check) where a lender will give you a <i>very</i>
      high-interest rate to pay pack the loan. These loans are typically based upon your income as opposed to your
      credit score. These loans usually have you pay the amount in full plus the interest that was accrued with your
      next paycheck. This can be dangerous and can continue a cycle of not having any money for expenses with your next
      paycheck.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>&emsp;Debt Consolidation Loans</h2>
    </button>

    <div class="accordian_content">
      Debt consolidation loans are loans that are for a specified amount and are used to pay of your other loans so that
      you can have a lower monthly payment, and if possible, a lower interest rate. Debt consolidation loans can be
      secured or unsecured loans. Secured loans usually have lower interest rates than unsecured loans and are more
      likely to be approved.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Secured loan:</strong>
          <br>
          This means you offer the bank/credit union collateral to secure the loan. Typically, the collateral is a house
          or vehicle that is fully owned by you. If you don't pay back the loan, the bank gets to keep your collateral.
          <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unsecured loan:</strong>
          <br>
          An unsecured loan is where you do not have any collateral to offer the lender. Unsecured loans usually have a
          higher interest rate and a lower loan amount.

    <!--- maybe change styles of the following buttons --->

    <h3>1. Debt</h3>
    <ul>
      Debt is the amount of money you owe other people or companies.
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Amortization Schedule</h3>
    <ul>
      An amortization schedule is a table (and if available a chart) that shows how the amount of the monthly payment
      breaks down between the amount paid to the mortgage principal and the amount of the payment paid to the interest
      of the loan. This table allows a person to see how much they pay in interest over time, how their payment is being
      split and how their loan balance changes over time.

      Factors used to calculate the amortization table include the initial loan amount, closing costs that may increase
      the loan amount, and thereby the monthly payments. Interest rates affect the monthly total payment of the loan as
      well. The higher the interest rate, the higher the total payment. However, interest payment amounts are higher at
      the beginning of the loan repayment so that the lender is paid before more upfront in repayments.
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Loan Calculators</h3>
    <ul>
      Loan calculators are a tool you can use to determine if you can afford the monthly payments of a loan. Loan
      caluclators allow an individidual to input initial loan amounts, loan terms, loan length of time, interest rate,
      and the APR to help a user determine their monthly payment.
