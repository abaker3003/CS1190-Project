      Credit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Credit is the money you can borrow. This money is on loan and does not belong to you personally. You are allowed to borrow a certain amount and creditors assume  you can return the borrowed money to them.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Credit Score
    </h2>
    <p>
      Credit Score is the rating that you receive from credit reporting agencies. Your credit score is a rating that give lenders a scale on how fiscally trustworthy you are and how likely you are to pay the loan amount (plus interest) in full.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three major credit reporting agencies and they list your personal credit score. It is not unusal for each credit reporting agency to have a different credit score for you, but the credit scores will stay in the same range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major credit reporting agencies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      Experian
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Equifax
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Transunion
    </ul>

    <p>
      The higher your credit score is the more like you are to be allowed to be approved for a line of credit, receive lower Annual Percentage Rates (APR), and receive a higher credit spending limit.

    <h2>
      Credit Cards
    </h2>
    <p>
      Credit cards are the typical mechanism that creditors use to allow an individual to borrow money so that the individual can pay vendors.
    </p>

    <h2>
      APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Creditors do not let you borrow money for free. Credit cards and credit accounts typically have an APR. An APR is a rate the creditors charge you for borrowing money in addition to the money that you borrowed. It is their payment for letting you borrow money and how they make money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your credit score will fall into a range that that creditors can you to determine your credit-worthiness.
