    Credit is the money you can borrow. This money is on loan and does not belong to you personally. You are allowed
    to borrow a certain amount and creditors assume you can return the borrowed money to them.

    Credit Score is the rating that you receive from credit reporting agencies. Your credit score is a rating that
    give lenders a scale on how fiscally trustworthy you are and how likely you are to pay the loan amount (plus
    interest) in full.
    <p></p>
    There are three major credit reporting agencies and they list your personal credit score. It is not unusal for
    each credit reporting agency to have a different credit score for you, but the credit scores will stay in the same
    range.
    <p></p>
    The major credit reporting agencies are:
    <ul>
      <li>Experian</li>
      <li>Equifax</li>
      <li>Transunion</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    The higher your credit score is the more like you are to be allowed to be approved for a line of credit, receive
    lower Annual Percentage Rates (APR), and receive a higher credit spending limit.

    Credit cards are the typical mechanism that creditors use to allow an individual to borrow money so that the
    individual can pay vendors.

    Creditors do not let you borrow money for free. Credit cards and credit accounts typically have an APR. An APR is
    a rate the creditors charge you for borrowing money in addition to the money that you borrowed. It is their
    payment for letting you borrow money and how they make money.
    <p></p>
    Your credit score will fall into a range that that creditors can use to determine your credit-worthiness.
